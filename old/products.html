                <p>EVA EMR is designed from the ground up to be an easy to use and efficient tool for clinical and administrative staff to use. 
                    <br>
                    One important design decision was to give our users the ability to scale up Eva's features as they grow. When a single practitioner expands his practice, or a hospital system opens a new facility: EVA EMR offers unique features which give it's users unparalled migration possibilities. 
                    <br> What does that mean? It's designed to quickly accomodate on all scales of users needs.

         <p> For the busiest doctors, they can encounter multiple EMRs depending on where they are practicing. Busy doctors practice in more than one location, and for more than one hospital system. Having EVA Cloud access allows you to deal with one EMR no matter what hospital or practice you are making your rounds in. </p>
         <p> Simply upload the blank documentation from each location to EVA cloud, and then pull up the documentation on your phone, tablet, or laptop. Once finished, save, print, and upload. Let EVA do the rest for you.</p>

        <h2>Do clinicals your way. We'll automate the rest</h2>
        <p>One of the most common reasons in denials and delays in patient treatment by the insurance companies are key details missing from documentation. EVA Ehr is the world's first EMR to tackle this head on, by offering workflow automation. </p>
        <p>We allow clinical staff to continue doing clinicals their own way, but when they are ready to submit their clinical information for treatment authorization, Eva automatically pulls up and directs the doctors submission based on the patient's insurance requirements. That's right. Welcome to the Age of AutoAuthorize. </p>
        
        <h3>Care Calls</h3>
        <p>Contacting the insurance company has never been easier.</p>
        <p>No one likes being put on hold, only to have to spend valuable time hunting and finding patient demographics that aren't always readily available. With CareCall, if a clinical or administrative staff has a question, or issue that needs to be addressed with the insurance company: they simply press the carecall button. This button autogenerates a number and can send it directly to the doctors phone, or office VOIP solutions. If neither of those options exist, the care call will automatically display the phone number for the clinical staff to call. Once a representative picks up, the doctor simply has to provide the CareCall number that was generated, and the insurance representative can see exactly what the doctor sees. </p> 
        
        <h3>Autobill and Autoclaim</h3>
        <p>Insurances have the ability to allow practices the ability to automatically bill after patient encounters, which will drastically improve reimbursement, and virtually reduce denials and resubmit requests.</p>
